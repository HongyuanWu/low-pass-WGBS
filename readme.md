Circulating cell-free DNA based low-pass genome-wide bisulfite sequencing aids non-invasive surveillance to Hepatocellular carcinoma

* Whole genome bisulfite sequencing and data processing
* Identification of the optimal region size of long range methylation (LRM)
* Randomly re-sampling lower reads from medium WGBS data
* Identification of hyper-LRMs and hypo-LRMs
* Identification and annotation of the differentially methylated CpGs (DMCs) and genes (DMGs)
* The enrichment score in each genomic region
* DNA methylation of CpGs near the HBV integration sites in chronic hepatitis, cirrhosis and HCC 
* Prediction analysis, logistic regression, Random Forest and ROC curves 
*
